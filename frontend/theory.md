# DSA Playground — Theory Notes

This file contains short notes about the algorithms and data structures in the project.

## Bubble Sort
- Idea: Repeatedly compare adjacent items and swap if necessary. Larger elements "bubble" to the end.
- Time: O(n^2) average/worst, O(n) best (nearly sorted with early exit).
- Space: O(1).

## Linked List (Singly)
- Nodes contain value and pointer to next.
- Good for fast inserts/deletes at head.
- Traversal is O(n).

## Stack
- LIFO structure. Operations: push, pop, peek. Often implemented with an array or linked list.

## Queue
- FIFO structure. Operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek.
